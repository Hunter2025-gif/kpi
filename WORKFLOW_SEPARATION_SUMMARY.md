# WORKFLOW SEPARATION COMPLETE

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Role Separation
- **Store Manager**: Now handles raw material release AFTER regulatory approval (step before dispensing)  
- **Dispensing Manager**: Handles material dispensing to production (formerly store manager function)

### 2. Workflow Flow
```
BMR Creation (QA) → Regulatory Approval → Store Manager (Release) → Dispensing Manager (Dispensing) → Production Phases
```

### 3. Dashboard Updates

#### Store Manager Dashboard (`store_dashboard.html`)
- Shows approved BMRs needing material release
- Allows creating and completing raw material releases
- Uses RawMaterialRelease model for tracking
- Statistics: pending releases, in progress, completed today, total approved BMRs

#### Dispensing Manager Dashboard (`dispensing_dashboard.html`)  
- Shows material dispensing phases (the original store manager function)
- Uses BatchPhaseExecution for material_dispensing phase
- POST actions: start/complete dispensing
- Statistics: pending phases, in progress, completed today, total batches

### 4. View Updates

#### `store_dashboard` view
- Role check: `store_manager`
- Handles RawMaterialRelease creation and completion
- Shows approved BMRs and release workflow
- Template: `store_dashboard.html`

#### `dispensing_dashboard` view  
- Role check: `dispensing_manager`
- Handles material dispensing phases (original store manager logic)
- Uses WorkflowService.get_phases_for_user_role with 'store_manager' role for phases
- Template: `dispensing_dashboard.html`

### 5. Navigation Routing
Updated `dashboard_home` function with correct role mapping:
- `store_manager` → `store_dashboard` (raw material release)
- `dispensing_manager` → `dispensing_dashboard` (material dispensing)

### 6. Database Models
- **RawMaterialRelease**: Tracks raw material releases from store to dispensing
- **BatchPhaseExecution**: Continues to handle material_dispensing phase execution

### 7. Workflow Integration
- Store Manager creates release after regulatory approval
- Dispensing Manager receives materials and starts dispensing phase
- Original workflow logic preserved for production phases

## Testing Required
1. Test store manager can create/complete material releases
2. Test dispensing manager can start/complete dispensing phases  
3. Verify workflow progression from approval → release → dispensing → production
4. Check both dashboards show correct data and statistics
5. Verify role-based access controls work correctly

## Benefits
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Better tracking of material flow
- Maintains existing production workflow
- Proper audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Role-specific dashboards with relevant data
