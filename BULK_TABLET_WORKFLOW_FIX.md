# Bulk Tablet Workflow Fix Report

## Issue Identified
We identified an issue where Type 2 tablets were incorrectly going to secondary packaging instead of bulk packing after the coating phase. This was affecting the workflow progression and causing product handling inconsistencies.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The ProductionPhase model had the correct phase definitions, but there was an ordering issue
2. For Type 2 tablets (tablet_type='tablet_2'), the bulk_packing phase was correctly defined in the workflow but had the same phase_order as secondary_packaging or was ordered after it
3. This caused the system to activate secondary_packaging before bulk_packing when coating was completed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Phase Order Correction
- Updated ProductionPhase records to ensure bulk_packing comes before secondary_packaging
- Fixed the order for all existing BMRs so that bulk_packing has a lower phase_order than secondary_packaging

### 2. Workflow Status Fix
- Updated BatchPhaseExecution statuses to properly activate bulk_packing after coating is completed
- Ensured that Type 2 tablets follow the correct workflow: coating -> bulk_packing -> secondary_packaging

### 3. Data Population for Charts
- Added data generation for the empty chart panels in the admin dashboard:
  - Production by Product Type
  - Phase Completion Status
  - Weekly Production Trend
  - Quality Control Status

## Verification Tests
1. `fix_bulk_tablet_workflow.py` - Identified and fixed ordering issues in existing BMRs
2. `test_bulk_tablet_workflow.py` - Verified that the workflow order is correct for specific BMRs
3. `test_new_bulk_tablet_workflow.py` - Confirmed that newly created BMRs have the correct workflow

## Results
All tests confirm that:
- The bulk_packing phase is correctly inserted after coating/packaging_material_release and before secondary_packaging
- The workflow correctly progresses from coating to bulk_packing for Type 2 tablets
- The phase order values ensure proper progression through the manufacturing process

## Future Prevention
The logic in workflow/services.py was already correct, but phase ordering issues had accumulated in the database. The fix has corrected all existing BMRs and future BMRs will follow the correct workflow.

## Dashboard Enhancements
Added data collection for the dashboard charts, including:
- Production by product type
- Phase completion rates
- Weekly production trends
- QC pass/fail statistics

This data will be displayed in the empty chart panels in the admin dashboard.
