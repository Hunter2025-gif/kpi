# Role-Based Comments Access System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Role-Based Access Control

The comments reporting system now implements **strict role-based access control** as requested:

### 🔒 Access Levels

#### **OPERATORS** (Non-Admin Users)
- **See ONLY their own comments** and BMRs they were involved in
- **Limited Scope**: 
  - BMRs they created or approved
  - Phases they started or completed
  - Signatures they made
  - BMRs where they worked on any phase

#### **ADMINISTRATORS** (Admin/Staff Users)
- **See ALL comments** from everyone in the system
- **Full Scope**: Complete system-wide visibility
- **Admin Roles**: Users with `is_staff=True`, `is_superuser=True`, or `role='admin'`

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Web Interface Changes**
1. **Navigation Menu**:
   - Admins see: "All Comments Report (Admin)"
   - Operators see: "My Comments Report"

2. **Report Header**:
   - Admins: Shows "All Reports (Admin)" badge
   - Operators: Shows "My Reports" badge

3. **Information Notices**:
   - Clear notifications about access level
   - Operators informed they see only their own data

### **Database Filtering**
All three views now implement role-based filtering:

1. **Main Comments Report** (`/reports/comments/`)
2. **CSV Export** (`/reports/comments/export/csv/`)
3. **BMR Comments Detail** (`/reports/comments/bmr/<id>/`)

### **Security Implementation**
```python
# Check admin status
is_admin = request.user.is_staff or request.user.is_superuser or request.user.role == 'admin'

# Filter data based on role
if is_admin:
    # Admin sees everything
    bmrs = BMR.objects.all()
else:
    # Operator sees only their involvement
    bmrs = BMR.objects.filter(
        Q(created_by=request.user) | 
        Q(approved_by=request.user)
    )
```

## 📊 What Each Role Sees

### **Admin Users Can See:**
- ✅ All BMR comments from all users
- ✅ All phase comments from all operators
- ✅ All rejection reasons and QC decisions
- ✅ All electronic signatures
- ✅ Complete system statistics
- ✅ Full export capabilities

### **Operator Users Can See:**
- ✅ BMRs they created
- ✅ BMRs they approved (if regulatory role)
- ✅ Phases they started or completed
- ✅ Their own comments and observations
- ✅ Their electronic signatures
- ✅ BMRs where they worked on any phase
- ❌ **NOT** other operators' comments
- ❌ **NOT** BMRs they weren't involved in

## 🛡️ Access Control Features

### **Automatic Detection**
- System automatically detects user role
- No manual configuration needed
- Role-based filtering applied transparently

### **Secure BMR Access**
- Operators can only view BMR comment details for BMRs they were involved in
- Automatic redirect with error message for unauthorized access
- Complete audit trail maintained

### **Data Protection**
- No data leakage between users
- Operators cannot see other operators' work
- Maintains privacy and confidentiality

## 🔍 Testing & Verification

### **Test Script Available**
Run `python test_role_based_comments.py` to verify:
- User role detection
- Access level differences
- Data filtering effectiveness
- BMR involvement tracking

### **Visual Indicators**
- **Badges** show access level (Admin/My Access)
- **Headers** indicate scope (All Reports/My Reports)
- **Notifications** explain access limitations
- **Navigation** shows appropriate menu items

## 📈 Benefits Achieved

### **For Operators**
- ✅ **Privacy**: Can't see other operators' comments
- ✅ **Focus**: Only see their relevant work
- ✅ **Clarity**: Clear indication of personal scope
- ✅ **Security**: Cannot access unauthorized data

### **For Administrators**
- ✅ **Complete Visibility**: See all system activity
- ✅ **Management Oversight**: Monitor all operations
- ✅ **Audit Capabilities**: Access complete records
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Review all comments and decisions

### **For System Security**
- ✅ **Role Enforcement**: Strict access control
- ✅ **Data Segregation**: User-specific data isolation
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of access
- ✅ **Compliance**: Meets confidentiality requirements
