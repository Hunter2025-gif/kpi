# ROLE CLEANUP SUMMARY - Dispensing Manager Removed

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed dispensing_manager Role**
- Removed `dispensing_manager` from dashboard routing in `dashboards/views.py`
- Updated workflow services to use `dispensing_operator` instead of `dispensing_manager`
- Deleted the `dispensing_dashboard` view function completely
- Removed `dispensing_dashboard` URL pattern

### 2. **Updated Role Mapping**
- **Store Manager (`store_manager`)**: Handles `raw_material_release` phase
- **Dispensing Operator (`dispensing_operator`)**: Handles `material_dispensing` phase via operator dashboard
- All other roles remain unchanged

### 3. **Dashboard Routing Now**
```python
'store_manager': 'dashboards:store_dashboard',           # Raw material release
'dispensing_operator': 'dashboards:operator_dashboard',  # Material dispensing (OLD STYLE)
```

### 4. **Workflow Sequence**
```
BMR Creation → Regulatory Approval → Raw Material Release (Store Manager) → Material Dispensing (Dispensing Operator) → Production Phases
```

### 5. **Files Modified**
- `dashboards/views.py`: Removed dispensing_dashboard function, updated routing
- `dashboards/urls.py`: Removed dispensing_dashboard URL
- `workflow/services.py`: Updated role mapping to use dispensing_operator
- `templates/dashboards/dispensing_dashboard.html`: Deleted (no longer needed)

### 6. **User Interface**
- **Store Manager**: Uses store_dashboard.html (raw material release workflow)
- **Dispensing Operator**: Uses operator_dashboard.html (THE OLD BLUE STYLE YOU WANTED)
- No more fancy "Dispensing Manager Dashboard" - only the simple operator dashboard

## Benefits
✅ **Single Dashboard Style**: Only the old operator dashboard style is used  
✅ **Clear Role Separation**: Store manager releases, dispensing operator dispenses  
✅ **Proper Workflow**: Sequential activation of phases  
✅ **No Confusion**: Removed the duplicate dispensing_manager role  

## Testing Required
1. Test that `dispensing_operator` role sees material dispensing phases in operator dashboard
2. Verify store manager can release materials and it triggers dispensing phase
3. Check that workflow progresses correctly: release → dispensing → production

The system now uses only the old-style operator dashboard for dispensing operators, exactly as requested!
